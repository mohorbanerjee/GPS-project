The “Smart Car Accident System” is an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) solution meticulously designed to enhance vehicle safety. This system ingeniously integrates a variety of hardware components. The Ultra Sound - HCSR04 is used for precise distance measurement, while the GPS - ublox neo6m provides accurate geolocation data. 

The Gyro - MPU6050 measures rotational motion, and the Servo Motor - SG90 controls mechanical movement. The system also includes a Buzzer for audible alerts, an LED for visual indicators, and an ESP32 microcontroller with Wi-Fi capabilities. 

The system is powered by a 5-volt DC Power Supply and uses a Wi-Fi Module for wireless communication. The software integration is achieved using Thonny version v3.1.0 and Micropython v1.22.1 with a generic ESP32 module. 

A user-friendly application, developed in Android Studio, provides features like live location tracking, path coverage, and accident notifications. All backend services are hosted on Google Firebase, ensuring reliable and secure data management. This project is a testament to the potential of IoT in revolutionizing vehicle safety.
